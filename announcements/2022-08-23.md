For the next class, I recommend doing the following. If you've already tried to troubleshoot and you need some additional, please attend the TA office hours.

* If you are on a Mac, find the terminal in the Applications/Utilities folder and drag it to your Dock.

* If you are on Windows 10 or greater (you should be) then install WSL2: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install


* If you are on Linux, I'm guessing you already know how to use terminal

* Everyone create a GitHub account

* Everyone install git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git


* Set up SSH with GitHub (I recommend that you use a password-less SSH key -- just accept the defaults while running ssh-keygen): https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh


* Read Topjian: 2, 3, 4, 6 -- not 3 Advanced, 4 Advanced, 6 Advanced)Â
